# PAGES2k Database v1.0 (Beta)

Welcome to the PAGES2k Network Data Product portal V1.0 Beta. This portal acts as a gateway to access databases, reconstructions and other major products produced by each of the PAGES2k Network Working Groups during Phases 1-3 of the PAGES2k Network project. The portal describes individual databases, and provides information on  how to access and download datasets, linking to each external dataset archive. Tools for online visualisation for individual databases are currently in development, as well as other steps to improve the interoperability between different databases and their derived analyses. 

## How to use this portal:
Navigate to each database via the sidebar menu or the buttons below. Databases are grouped by their PAGES2k Network phase, by variable or proxy type, and by working group. For example, past versions of the PAGES2k Network Global Temperature Proxy Database and accompanying reconstructions are found under "Global Temperature Compilations" within the "Phase 1-2 Databases" Umbrella in the side bar. Additionally, you can search by keyword using the search bar in the top left corner.

Each database page contains a summary of the database describing the data and metadata available, instructions on how to access and use this data, links to the original publication and data archive on WDS Paleo, Figshare and/or LiPDVerse, and instructions on how to contact the original database Authors or get involved with future projects. 

## Accessing the Database Mapping Tools:
A map of individual databases can be viewed by navigating to the "Phase 1-2 Database map viewer" page under the "Database Mapping tools" umbrella in the sidebar. This map allows you to view all records associated with each database in phases 1-2. records can be viewed by archive type or by proxy measurement type, and each record includes a pop-up containing a link to the original dataset, link to the associated database, and information about the dataset itself.

To use the map, select the database you wish to view via the dropdown menu. Information on individual records can be viewed by clicking on their marker, and records within a database can be viewed by archive or proxy measurement type. Further mapping tools are currently in development.

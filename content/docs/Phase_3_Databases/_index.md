# Phase 3 Databases

Phase 3 of the PAGES 2k network has focussed on the creation of databases using specific proxies. Three databases are in the process of being completed; the Iso2k Hydroclimate water isotope database (completed 2020), the CoralHydro2K Sr/Ca, δ<sup>18</sup>O, and δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw</sub> Coral database (estimated 2022 completion), and the CLIVASH2K  Sodium and Sulphate ice core database (estimated 2022 completion).

These database pages can be found in the tabs below, under their corresponding working group. If you wish to be involved with the production of these projects, please see the working group main pages and join the listserve.

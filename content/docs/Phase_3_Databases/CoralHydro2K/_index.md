## Summary of Database 
The database focusses on paired Strontium-calcium ratio (Sr/Ca)  and oxygen isotope ( δ<sup>18</sup>O) records from modern and fossil corals over the Holocene period. The record sources include the Pacific, Atlantic, North Atlantic, and Indian ocean basins, with derived SST, SSTA, and  δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw</sub> variables expected to be included in this database. The majority of records cover the time period between 1800-2020CE (70%), whilst 30% span pre-1800CE.

This database builds upon the OCEAN2k, and ISO2k projects, and initially records were taken from these two databases. The criteria for records was then expanded to include records published more recently, shorter records, records of lower resolutions, and Sr/Ca only records. Version 1.0.0 of the database will be broken up into seven tiers of records to categorise records by these factors, and is described in Table.1 below. 

### Summary of the datasets within the database: 
Table. 1: Summary of the tier system used in the Coralhydro2k database
|Tier Level| Proxy type |Number of Records| Resolution|Covers the 20th Century? |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------------|
|Tier 1|Paired δ<sup>18</sup>O and Sr/Ca| XX | Atleast 2 observations/year | Yes | 
|Tier 2|Paired δ<sup>18</sup>O and Sr/Ca| XX | Atleast 2 observations/year | No |
|Tier 3|Paired δ<sup>18</sup>O and Sr/Ca| XX |Annual or Lower| |
|Tier 4| δ<sup>18</sup>O| XX | Atleast 2 observations/year| |
|Tier 5| δ<sup>18</sup>O| XX | Annual or lower | |
|Tier 6| Sr/Ca| XX |Atleast 2 observations/year| |
|Tier 7| Sr/Ca| XX |Annual or lower | |
|Total| | 227| | |


### Summary of Metadata:
The metadata will be a machine readable, metadata-rich network of paired records, and follows both MARPA and PaCTS guidelines. This targeted set of metadata identifies each coral record and informs the use of its proxy data. Metadata includes the geographic location, publication links, calibration, analysis, and chronology information. The database will be stored on the LiPDverse, with a long term repository on NOAA WDS PALEO which will also feature a folder of csv files for each record. 

A talk was given on the PAGES Seminar series, describing the database, which can be found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES-C5Nv_DfM&ab_channel=PastGlobalChanges)
## How to access database:

This database is currently in development, however once published it will be accessable via the LiPDverse, with planned serializations available for MATLAB, Python and R, and containing a link to WDS paleo for .csv files.

## Want to submit data to this database?
This Database will be updated annually, crowd sourcing new records through a data submission form (Hit the button below to add your data!). Datasets can also be added to this database via the LiPD playground. For more information on the LiPDverse, and how its useful for paleoclimate data storage, see the [LiPDverse Website](https://lipd.net/).

A δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>sw</sub> database is currently also in development, and an introduction video can be found here: [how to add seawater data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYkDm6S7fNM&ab_channel=PastGlobalChanges). Further information for this database, and a form to submit data can be found here: [data submission form](https://fsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_094ofPIJKM5KNyC)

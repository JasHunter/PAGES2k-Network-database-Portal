## Summary of database:

This study presented a spatial reconstruction of hydroclimate variability in the Northern Hemisphere from 800-2000AD, and utilizes 196 previously published proxy records, all more than 1000-years in length and with a minimum resolution of 50-years/observation (Figure. A). Datasets have been standardized to allow for cross-proxy comparison. A compilation of 128 temperature proxy records is also included, to understand the relationship between hydroclimate and temperature variability and how it changes over the past 12 centuries. The study compares the resulting gridded reconstruction with climate model simulations of northern hemispheric hydroclimate and temperature variability.

## How to access data:

This database is archived on NOAA WDS PALEO, containing citation information, metadata information, data description files, and a data folder. 

The data folder contains:
* Separate zipfiles of the hydroclimate proxy data and the temperature proxy data used in the study.
* Subdirectories "hydroproxies" and "tempproxies", containing textfiles of individual records for hydroclimate and temperature analysis respectively. records are shown by site name in alphabetical order.
* Zipfiles of  the code and software used to produce the experiments described  in the study publication, with example data and runtime commands. 
* Textfiles of all source data used to plot the different figures in the study, including Extended Data Figures 1-9.
* A readme file describing all datasets and code available in the directory, as well as information about the study.

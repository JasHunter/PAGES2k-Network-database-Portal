## Summary of reconstruction:
This study reconstructed Australian cool (April-September) and warm (October-March) season rainfall over 1200-1600CE, using an extensive network of palaeoclimate proxies from the Southern Hemisphere. The proxy network was made up of 185 records, sourced from a variety of proxy archives. All records relate to Australian climate directly or as a teleconnection, with the majority of records taken from the Australasia and New Zealand Summer Drought Atlas (ANZDA) (Palmer et al., 2015), or from PAGES Ocean2k data products (Neukom and Gergis, 2012; Tierney et al., 2015). The range of records used are described in Table. A below. To be included in the proxy network, records had to extend back to at least 1880CE, have a minimum annual resolution, and have met the requirements for the ANZDA and Ocean 2K data products respectively.


| Proxy archive | Number of Records| Region | Resolution (No. Records)|
|---------------|------------------|--------|------------|
|Tree-Rings| 131|Australasian-Pacific region| Annual (131) |
|Coral|36|Tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans| Annual (11), Sub-annual (25)|
|Speleothem |5|Australasian-Pacific| Annual (5)|
|Ice Cores|13|Antarctic region| Annual (13)|

The proxy network was used to reconstruct cool and warm seasons of rainfall in eight geographically distinct areas of Australia. The eight Natural resource management (NBRM) regions can be seen in the figure below, and were identified as; the Monsoonal North, the Wet Tropics, The East Coast, The Central Slopes, the Murray Basin, the southern and south-western flatlands, the southern Slopes, and the Rangelands. A nested, composite-plus-scale (CPS) approach is used to reconstruct the rainfall average for each region.

## How to access reconstruction data:

The results of the reconstructions are archived in Melbourne university's Figshare repository, and can be accessed via the button below, or at the top of the page. The study page includes citation information, descriptions of the files and NBRM regions, and past versions of the dataset. The table below describes the data files available for download. Files are formatted in both netcdf and text format,and the text versions can be previewed by clicking on the chosen dataset. You can access to the figshare site via the button below, or at the top of the page. The full list of proxies used is available in the supplementary section of [Freund et al., 2017](https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/13/1751/2017/cp-13-1751-2017.html), as a pdf table.

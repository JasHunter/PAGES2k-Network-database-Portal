## Summary of Database:

This Database was created by the NAm2K project, containing 510 borehole temperature-depth profiles that are valid for use in climate studies. Each borehole record also includes supplementary metadata about the profile. Data is available in csv or text files, and example code is available for use.  A map of the database created using the PAGES2K Phase 1-2 Mapping viewer is shown in Figure. A below.

To be included in the database, temperature profiles had to be at minimum 300m deep, include 10+ measurements, and pass visual discontinuity and perturbation inspections. Following the creation of the database, the profiles were used to reconstruct GST histories over the past 500 years, and the results of this can be found in [Jaume-Santero et al (2016)](https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-2181-2016).

## Summary of database:

This database is a compilation of low-resolution (greater than annual resolution) paleoclimate records from the Australasian region over the Common Era (0-2000AD). 675 records were collated, and screened against the following criteria to identify high quality records for further analysis: 
* Must show evidence that it is related to at least one climate variable.
* Cover at minimum 500years of the Common Era.
* Include an age model based on at least two-three chronological anchors.
* Have a sample resolution of 2-50years per observation.
* Be located within an area that influences the climate of the Australasian region, defined as 90◦ E–140◦ W, 10◦ N–80◦ S by the Aus2K group ([Gergis et al., 2016](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/29/15/jcli-d-13-00781.1.xml)).

A total of 22 records passed screening, and were used to analyse climate variability of the Australasian region over decadal to centennial timescales. The records include archives from lakes, peatland and wetlands, marine sediments, and speleothems. A table of the 22 records can be found in [Dixon et al., (2017)](https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/13/1403/2017/).

## How to access data:

This database is archived on NOAA WDS PALEO, and the study page can be accessed via the button below or at the top of the page. The study page contains citation information, metadata information, and a data folder containing data and data-description files. The data folder contains:
* A Readme file describing the data collection.
* Individual .xlsx and .txt files of each individual record used in the subset analysis (22 files). Each file contains the available metadata, a comparison between published and recalibrated age models for the site, and the data itself.
* A Zip file containing all records for ease of download.

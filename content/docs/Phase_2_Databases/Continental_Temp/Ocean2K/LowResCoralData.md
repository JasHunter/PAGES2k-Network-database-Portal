## Summary of Database 
 
The Ocean2k Synthesis dataset is a global synthesis of marine based sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions for the common era (0-2000CE). A total of 57 individual marine reconstructions were used, mostly along the ocean basin edges (Figure. A). To be included in the compilation, records had to meet the following criteria:
* Data is from a marine archive, is peer-reviewed and publicly archived.
* Has a minimum sample resolution of 1 observation per every 200years, span atleast two consecutive 200year bins.
* Contains at least two age dates between 200 before the common era (BCE), and 2015CE.
* The timeseries is a SST reconstruction, and not included in the Ocean2k "high Resolution" Synthesis ([Tierney et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014PA002717)).

Upon inclusion into the synthesis, records were placed into 200 year bins and standardised. Analysis with this dataset found a robust cooling trend from 1-1800CE, and is compared to other terrestrial reconstructions for the same period. Further detail on the results of this, and the details of the synthesis data can be found in the publication ([McGregor et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2510)). Metadata for each record used in the synthesis is included in the supplementary section, and this includes information about the site of each record, the proxy type and seasonality, and calibration and sampling resolution information. Links to the original data products and publications are also included, along with a short comment section describing any record specific nuances that need to be recorded.
